# Rune Python Runtime

*Rune Python Runtime* - the runtime supports and is an integral part of Python code generated from a [Rune DSL](https://github.com/finos/rune-dsl) defined model.  Rune DSL is a Domain-Specific Language used to model Financial Markets activities including the [Common Domain Model (CDM)](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model).  

The Rune Python Runtime is used in collaboration with the [Rune Python Code Generator](https://github.com/REGnosys/rune-python-generator) to translate a Rune DSL model into a fully usable Python package.

## Installation

The runtime is not generally installed on a stand alone basis but rather comes as part of a generated package such as CDM.

Regardless, to install the package standalone:

1. Fetch the latest release data from the GitHub API
```sh
release_data=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/REGnosys/rune-python-runtime/releases/latest)
```
2. Extract the download URL of the first asset
```sh
download_url=$(echo "$release_data" | grep '"browser_download_url":' | head -n 1 | sed -E 's/.*"([^"]+)".*/\1/')
```
3. Download the artifact using wget or curl
```sh
wget "$download_url"
```

4. Install the Runtime
```sh
python -m pip install rune.runtime*-py3-*.whl
```

## Development setup
### Setup for developers
This guide is meant for everyone who wants to contribute to the Rune Python Runtime and needs to get things up and running.
### 1. Clone the Project
Start by cloning the project: `git clone https://github.com/regnosys/rune-python-generator`

### 2. Setup the Development Environment
Use [dev_clean_setup.sh](https://github.com/Cloudrisk/rune-python-runtime/blob/main/dev_clean_setup.sh) to setup a development environment.

```sh
./dev_clean_setup.sh
```
### 3. Build
Use [build_wheel.sh](https://github.com/Cloudrisk/rune-python-runtime/blob/main/build_wheel.sh) to build the package
```sh
./build_wheel.sh
```
To run the unit tests:
```sh
test/run_runtime_tests.sh
```

## Roadmap

The Roadmap will be aligned to the Rune DSL and [CDM](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) roadmaps.

In addition, the intention is to make future releases available at [PyPi](https://pypi.org)
